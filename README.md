# Practical Machine Learning - Coursera Project

The data set mentioned in the assignement has huge in-complete data set, from 160 columns of data only ~50 columns are used to build the model. Most of the other columns are having lots of NA information. These columns were removed from final model. Four different algorithms(``random forest, cart, gbm, qda``)  used to build the model. Confusion matrix for Random Forest, CART, GBM are very similar, when these 3 models were applied to test data results were also exactly same but qda model result varied with others.
